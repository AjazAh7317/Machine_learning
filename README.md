# Machine_learning
In this i am going to study thsese topics
1. Introduction to Machine Learning

Definition, scope, and applications of ML

Types of learning: Supervised, Unsupervised, Semi-supervised, Reinforcement Learning

Key challenges in ML and performance evaluation metrics

2. Supervised Learning

Regression: Linear Regression, Multiple Regression, Polynomial Regression

Classification: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Naïve Bayes

Support Vector Machines (SVM): Linear and non-linear classification, Kernel methods

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC

3. Unsupervised Learning

Clustering: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN

Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

Association Rule Learning: Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms

4. Probabilistic Learning and Bayesian Methods

Bayesian Learning framework

Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)

Naïve Bayes Classifier and Bayesian Networks

5. Ensemble Methods

Bagging, Boosting (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting), Stacking

Random Forests and their optimization
